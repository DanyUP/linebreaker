Java library for line breaking


 - Introduction
This project aims to be a small java library for managing line breaking in
collections.
This library should work like a "group by" statement: you define when the
elements in the collection should be grouped (using a comparator) and then
you can define the actions to be executed for the first and the last element
of the collection and for each element.
